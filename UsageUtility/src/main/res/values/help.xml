    <string name="help_title_" formatted="false">Please read the following to understand the concept of <b>logs</b>, <b>plans</b> and <b>rules</b>:</string>

    <string name="help_import_" formatted="false">A good starting point are some preconfigured rule sets available on the website. Just import them via import menu and play around.</string>
    <string name="help_export_" formatted="false">If you managed to set up a common plan for your country, do not hesitate to export your rule set to me by mail. I will put it on the website to make it available for all the users.</string>

    <string name="help_logs_plans_rules_" formatted="false">There are three kinds of data structures:</string>
    <string name="help_logs_" formatted="false"><b>Logs</b> to save information about your calls, messages and traffic statistics.</string>
    <string name="help_plans_" formatted="false"><b>Plans</b> to describe all kinds of aspects of your bill.</string>
    <string name="help_rules_" formatted="false"><b>Rules</b> to match the <b>logs</b> and move them to a particular <b>plan</b>.</string>

    <string name="help_plans_detail0_" formatted="false">You can add or delete <b>plans</b> just as you want. You can set the order by dragging them around with the handle on the right of the list view.</string>
    <string name="help_plans_detail1_" formatted="false">To edit a <b>plan</b>, you just need to click it. At the next screen, you can set all kind of settings. There are a few, most users won\'t need. But some do. A short help for each setting is displayed in this view. Most settings you do not understand are not used in your country. Just leave them as they are. ;)</string>
    <string name="help_plans_merge_" formatted="false">You can merge <b>plans</b> to aggregate their <b>log items</b> to a combined cost and limit.</string>

    <string name="help_rules_detail0_" formatted="false">Edit the <b>rules</b> in the same way. Each <b>rule</b> does match some <b>log items</b> and move them to a <b>plan</b> in which the <b>logs</b> should be billed in.</string>
    <string name="help_rules_detail1_" formatted="false">But keep in mind, that order is important for <b>rules</b>:</string>
    <string name="help_rules_detail2_" formatted="false"><b>Logs</b> are matched <b>top-down</b>, means: the first <b>rule</b> that matches will stop processing of this particular <b>log item</b>.</string>
    <string name="help_rules_detail3_" formatted="false">E.g.: If you match all calls to 0800% numbers to a \"free\" <b>plan</b> with the first <b>rule</b>, there is no need to exclude these numbers in the second.</string>
